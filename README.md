# MooTweet: Mh-Mcl-Brand-Sentiment-App üêÆ

MooTweet is a data product that was built for the¬†Music Hackathon/Music Community Lab, a not-for-profit music organization. The real-time dashboard provides decision support‚Äîusing Python, NLP methods and Flask framework‚Äîto quantify individual and brand engagement on Twitter. 

Originally a modest Search API project, the streaming analytics app now performs sentiment analyses and measures engagement metrics that satisfy the original client goal: use the Twitter Search API to identify the organization‚Äôs most brand worthy account.

# Creating the app in Heroku

The 2 module app-- sharing a single Postgres database-- is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).


## Heroku

The application can be easily executed in [Heroku](https:/heroku.com) remote git branch/master. The steps:

> Get the code
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nickitaliano/mcl-mh-brand-sentiment-analysis-app
$ cd mcl-mh-brand-sentiment-analysis-app
```

> Visit `http://localhost:5005` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


<br/>


## Deployment 

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```

> Start the app using gunicorn binary

```bash
$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8001 run:app
# Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

> Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.
