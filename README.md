"Mootweet"-- which started as a web app for Music Information Retrieval(MIR) researchers, musicians, and engineers-- is a real-time streaming analytics dashboard using both data science music hacking!

The app features decision support, using Python's Dash and Flask framework, and Twitter's Search API. MooTweet can be tested and deployed both locally(Unix) and remotely(Heroku). 

Users can then monitor exploratory features plus NLP(Natural Language Processing) insights!


<br/>

# How to use it(Unix/Mac)
## Download and install the Heroku CLI

> If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.
```'bash 
$ heroku login
```
<br/>

> Create a new Git repository and initialize a git repository in a new or existing directory
```bash
$ cd mootweet/
$ git init
$ heroku git:remote -a mootweet
```
## Deploy your application
> Commit your code to the repository and deploy it to Heroku using Git.
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "make it better"
$ git push heroku master
```
<br/>

### Existing Git repository
> For existing repositories, simply add the heroku remote!
```bash
$ heroku git:remote -a mootweet
```
> Get the code
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nickitaliano/mcl-mh-brand-sentiment-analysis-app.git
$ cd mcl-mh-brand-sentiment-analysis-app/
```
<br/>

<br/>

> Virtualenv modules installation (Unix based systems)
```bash
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

<br/>

<br/>

> Install modules - SQLite Database
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> OR with PostgreSQL connector
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements-pgsql.txt
```

<br/>

<br/>

> Set the FLASK_APP environment variable(development only)
```bash
$ (Unix/Mac) export FLASK_APP=run.py
```
> Set up the DEBUG environment
```bash
$ (Unix/Mac) export FLASK_ENV=development
```

<br/>

<br/>

> Start the application (development mode)
```bash
$ --host=0.0.0.0 - expose the app on all network interfaces (default 127.0.0.1)
$ --port=5000    - specify the app port (default 5000)  
$ flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```

> Access the dashboard in browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`


<br/>

# Creating the app in Heroku

The 2 module app-- sharing a single Postgres database-- is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).


## Heroku

The application can be easily executed in [Heroku](https:/heroku.com) remote git branch/master. The steps:

> Get the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nickitaliano/mcl-mh-brand-sentiment-analysis-app
$ cd mcl-mh-brand-sentiment-analysis-app
```

<br/>

> Visit `http://localhost:5005` in your browser. The app should be up & running.
## Deployment 

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```
> Start the app using gunicorn binary

```bash
$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8001 run:app
# Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

> Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.
